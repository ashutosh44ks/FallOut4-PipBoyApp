# FallOut4-PipBoyApp

Fallout 4 is an action role-playing game and was released worldwide in late 2015.
The Pip-Boy, a personal computing device strapped to the player character's wrist,
allows the player to access a menu with statistics, maps, data, and items the player has acquired.

I have created a replica version of The PipBoy App. The site has working STAT->Status, INV->Weapons, and Maps pages.

Features:
  Green Filter for Images
  Scan Line Effect
  Progress Bars (static)
  Dynamic Response for INV->Weapons
  Google Map for MAP (without API)
